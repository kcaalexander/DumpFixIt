1) Indentation: 4 space per indentation level. No tabs only space.

2) line length 79 chars, longer line wrap with backslash (\) or with
   parentheses, brackets and braces.

3) 2 blank line around toplevel functions and classes.
   1 blank line around class methods.
   1 blank line to use is function where needed to seprate logical grps.

4) Python source files should be under utf-8 encoding. All source code
   files should have the magic comment, placed either as first or second line

   # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

5) import should one multiple lines; top of the file after module comments
   and docstrings. Wildcard imports ( from <module> import * ) should be
   avoided.

6) double-quoted strings should be always used. If string contains
   double-quotes use single-quoted strings. Avoid escaping as much as
   possible.

9) Naming Conventions:
   - Module Names: short, all-lowercase names. Underscores can be
   used in the module name if it improves readability.
   - Package Names: short, all-lowercase names with no underscores.
   - Class Names: CapWords convention.
   - Global/Local Variables: should be lowercase, with words separated by
   underscores as necessary to improve readability. 
   - Function Names: should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores
   as necessary to improve readability. 
   - Public function, class member or data member: lowercase with words separated by
   underscores as necessary to improve readability. 
   - Protected function, class member or data member: leading underscore followed by
   lowercase with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
   - Private function, class member or data member: Two leading underscore followed by
   lowercase with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability.
   - Constants: all capital letters with underscores separating words.
 
10) Docstring Conventions:
   - All modules, functions, classes, class methods should have docstrings.
   - Always use """triple double quotes""" around docstrings.
   - If docstring contains characters to be escpaed use
     r"""raw triple double quotes""" around docstrings.
   - If docstring contains unicode characters use 
     u"""Unicode triple double quotes""" around docstrings.
   - No blank line either before or after the docstring.
   - A one-line docstring should be like
     """Do something and return something."""
   - A multi-line docstring should be like
     """
     Do something and return something.
     """
   - In Multi-line docstring, first line should be a summary line,
     followed by blank line, followed by more elaborate description,
     followed by arguments, side-effects/limitation/restriction,
     return, exceptions.

     """
     A single line to summrize.

     A detailed multi-line description of its behaviour.

     Note:
        Include any side-effects/limitation/restriction.

     Args:
        param1 (str): description of 'param1'
        param2 (int): description of 'param2', Defaults to None.

     Returns:
        tuple: description of return value.

     Raises:
        ValueError: description of when this exeception will raise.
