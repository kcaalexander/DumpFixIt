1. Starts getting executed from svndumpfixit.py present in the root folder.
2. TODO: not sure what should be done as part of pre-execution

    a) getopt() is used decide whether to use gnu or non-gnu getopt()
    b) validate first arg if present against commands naming convention
       ie: [[[
                 command    ::=  (letter|"_") (letter | digit | "_")*
                 letter     ::=  lowercase | uppercase
                 lowercase  ::=  "a"..."z"
                 uppercase  ::=  "A"..."Z"
                 digit      ::=  "0"..."9"
           ]]]
    c) call main(command, argv)
3. Main routine
    a) if no arg provided assume --help, call usage_help(None)
    b) if first arg is either --help or -h assume --help, usage_help(None)
4. Extension in details
5. Load Extension from predetermined location (TODO)
   b)
   a) All extension files should have the following magic comment, placed
      either as first or second line of the extension code.

      # -*- svndumpfixit: extension -*-

       Extension loader will look for this line before it assume the file
       as a svndumpfixit extension and proceed with extension load.
