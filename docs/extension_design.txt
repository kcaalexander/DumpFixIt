Extension or Plugins Design principles 
--------------------------------------
* Extension or plugins are way to hook features or function
  into the core.
* Extension are loose coupled.
* Shoul have a reduced extra overhead for writting an extension with
  very minimal line of bookkeeping codes.
* Plugins will be loaded everytime at start from specific pre-determined
  location, within the packages directory structure.
* There should a way to specifially identify a svndumpfixit plugins and
  plugin loaders (part of the core) should check this before even trying to
  load a given extension
* There need to be a point or a port (probabally in the form of a class)
  for the extension to hook into the core, by which nither the actual core
  nor the plugin need to handle the loading and processing or plugins.
* There need to be a way by wich plugins can register to the core.
* There need to be a way to get the full list of plugins that is registered
  with the core.
* There need to be a way for plugins to cherry pick functionally and
  implement only those once.
* More than one plugin can implement the same functionality so a way to
  decide the order is important.
